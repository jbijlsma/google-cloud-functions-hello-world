# This file specifies files that are _not_ uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#

# For more information, run:
# $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore

# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore

node_modules

# Including the line below will copy the content of the .gitignore file
!include:.gitignore

# Because we just want to upload the build folder, we will ignore the src folder instead
src
